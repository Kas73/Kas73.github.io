    <section id="section1">
        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>The elderly have limited social interaction because they don't go outside as much and this causes them to
            feel sad and lonely. Furthermore remaining healthy is a significant challenge once one is older with many
            not being able to track their medication and barely doing exercise contributing to their deteriorating
            health. Once the COVID-19 pandemic happened these problems were compounded to a greater extent making the
            situation for elderly people much more dire. Designing applications that the elderly can easily use is a
            challenge as well because they are not as adept with technology as younger generations. Finally, nowadays
            there are too many apps one must use to track their health and communicate so making an all-in-one app will
            both address the concerns of the elderly and make it easier to use.</p>
        <p><br>We hope that Elderly Helperly will be the one-stop solution where elderly people can both improve their
            health, feel connected with their loved ones and interact more with their community.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="section2">
        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>To develop Elderly Helperly extensive research was conducted to find the best trends and features to
            implement in our application. Different publications were analyzed to find the best practices to develop
            apps for the elderly. In terms of colours to be chosen for the design, it is important to use colours with
            contrast for an app that is easier to navigate and use [1]. Furthermore, buttons and colors should be kept
            big so they are more readable and easier to interact with [1]. These are two key principles that we will be
            keeping in mind while designing our application. Additionally, it is important to make it clear what is
            clickable in the application so navigation is simpler for the elderly [2]. We will be implementing this by
            only making buttons clickable within our application and not using any clickable text.</p>
        <p>To provide an alternative to loading data individually we have decided to implement an optional QR code
            reader that users can use to load bulk data. Our research showed that QR codes can help senior citizens by
            keeping more accurate records in terms of health [3]. Finally, we want to make sure that our users can
            easily navigate within our different screens therefore, we will be adding a back button to most of our
            screens. It is shown that this enhances user experience overall and can lead to less frustration when using
            the app [4]. Furthermore, the features we have chosen for our app are only what is required for users to
            achieve their goals and will make our application less complicated and more efficient. Finally, we have
            decided not to use icons in our application and decided to only use text to convey information. We believe
            this is the most efficient way of communicating with the elderly and research shows that is an area of
            concern for the elderly [5].
        </p>
        <h3>Survey</h3>
        <p>After extensive research was conducted we decided to develop a survey to gain insights on potential decisions
            we were going to make regarding the development of the application. A Google Survey was created that
            contained a mix of multiple choice, short answer and long answer that aimed at collecting data for us to use
            in our decision-making process. The survey and its disclosures can be seen
            <a href="./ImgSrc/Survey Blank.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> and below is our analysis of
            the information collected. Finally, all information that was collected remains confidential and the
            participants could remain anonymous.
        </p>
        <p>The results of our survey have been divided into design and functionality-related questions for easier
            analysis.</p>
        <h4>Design</h4>
        <p>Below are the results for all design-related questions of the survey. The information is displayed in pie
            charts to visualize the percentage weight of each answer.</p>

        <p>From the data gathered for this part of the survey, it can be seen that the vast majority of people believe
            colour consistency is important when developing an application for the elderly. Furthermore, the best colour
            pallet to use is rainbow, this concurs with the research we conducted because it makes it easier to
            differentiate buttons. The participants believe that colour consistency is important when designing and that
            minimalism confuses the elderly. People also believe that button placement is important when developing an
            app for the elderly because it leads to less confusion. Additionally, they believe that clickable text
            confuses the elderly and this aligns with what we found in the research we conducted. Finally, people
            believe that icons confuse the elderly, this is most likely because of the lack of labels when using them.

        <h4>Functionality</h4>
        <p>Below is the data for functionality-related questions of the survey along with the short and long answer
            questions.</p>

        <p>In regards to how many functions our app should have, people believe that 1 to 5 is best and this is because
            it makes the app simpler to navigate. Furthermore, people believe that implementing videos is a good feature
            to have for the elderly. A more controversial functionality is QR codes as a slight minority believe it's a
            good feature to have for the elderly. Some of the most prominent answers in terms of best app features
            regarding elderly people's health were exercise and medication tracking. However, some of the most prominent
            answers for worst app features regarding elderly people's health were journaling and maps because of the
            risk of confusion. Finally, the most common struggles for elderly people regarding applications were small
            buttons and texts and complicated apps to navigate. All of this data collected will be used in the app
            development process of application to ensure we have the best product possible.</p>

        <p>To better understand the userbase of our app, we created some personas of the expected demographic. We made
            sure to include a range of goals based off of our reseach. Furthermore, we included certain disabilities
            that can be expected from senior citizens.</p>

        <h3>Frankie</h3>
        <p>The first persona we made, Frankie, is a hard worker who likes to stay fit. He relies on others to help keep
            him on track, be it with his medications or his appointments. His years working with heavy equipment has
            rendered him hard of hearing. </p>
        <h3>Ginette</h3>
        <p>Ginette is a retiree with little remaining mobility. She's lived her whole life in french and would have a
            hard time using an english application. She would like an app that not only helps her keep up her exercises
            to improve her diminishing mobility, but would also require an app that caters to her degenerating sight.
            All the while, she aims to make some friends adn keep in touch with her family.</p>

        <p>Guillaume is the only young persona of the bunch. While we were thinking about the demographic of the app, a
            thought came up: "Who else will use the app beside the elderly?". For this reason, we included a younger
            person who might help their grandparent or an elder they know set up their account on the app.</p>
        <h3>Theresa</h3>
        <p>Finally there's Theresa, who represents an elder in the younger range, who wants an app to help keep her fit
            and that keeps track of various merdications. She's pretty tech savvy and aims to reduce the cluter on her
            phone by combining finding an app that combines multiple functionalities.</p>

            can perhaps be met with an all in one app.
            Following is the discovery of the app, where they find the app and decide to download it. They then set up
            and get to know the app. During their usage of the app, they determine whether their needs are met using the
            various functionalities of the app.

        <h2>Sketches</h2>
        <h3>Version 1</h3>
        <p>To start the app design process a series of sketches were completed to brainstorm and set out our initial
            design ideas for this application. The first version focuses on the features to be included in our app and
            how we want them to be presented and laid out. Furthermore, it shows the different screens needed to achieve
            the functionalities chosen.</p>

        <h3>Version 2</h3>
        <p>After the first version of sketches was completed several changes were made to create a more refined second
            version. The application flow was tested to identify missing buttons that were needed to navigate the app.
            Furthermore, certain buttons were made bigger and were spaced out more to ensure that navigation within the
            app was easier. Additionally, a core functionality was added in activity tracking that works similarly to
            medication tracking. Additional features were added like QR code loading of information and a timer to aid
            the users in their exercise sessions. Finally, the shake feature of the application was added in this
            version where users can shake their phone and this will bring them to the main menu.</p>

        <p>Using figma, we routed the buttons of the wireframe, showing the flow of user interaction with the various
            buttons of the design. It shows which frame each buttons leads to, giving perspective of how the app can be
            navigated.</p>

        <h2>Design</h2>
        <p>In the design portion, we added the colours from a colour palette we selected and prettied up the base
            wireframe. The
            buttons were rounded and drop shadows were added to the user interface to improve on the flat
            feeling of the design, giving it more depth. The colours were kept consistent by making all the inputs one
            colour and keeping the back and settings buttons the same throughout the application. Furthermore, we added
            a logo that we desgined to the login page.</p>

        <h3>Color scheme</h3>
        <p>The survey suggested both nude and rainbow colours would be best for our application; we went with two shades
            of beige for the background. The buttons and other interactive inputs of the app make use of a more varied
            rainbow aesthetic. We tried to keep the colours consistent throughout the app so that it wouldn't be too
            confusing.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>In conclusion, the survey and research conducted have provided valuable insights into the expectations for
            our application and design. This mini-project not only enhanced our understanding of the needs of elderly
            individuals but also enlightened us on the most suitable user interface for them. As the population ages,
            the evolving technological landscape ensures that newer generations, more accustomed to the internet and
            associated technologies, will continue to shape user preferences. This experience has been instrumental in
            aligning our project with the evolving needs of a tech-savvy aging population.</p>
