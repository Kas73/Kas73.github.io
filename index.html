        <h2>Personas</h2>
        <p>To better understand the userbase of our app, we created some personas of the expected demographic. We made
            sure to include a range of goals based off of our reseach. Furthermore, we included certain disabilities
            that can be expected from senior citizens.</p>

            <img src="./ImgSrc/Personas/Theresa.png" alt="Image 1.4">
        </div>
        <h3>Frankie</h3>
        <p>The first persona we made, Frankie, is a hard worker who likes to stay fit. He relies on others to help keep
            him on track, be it with his medications or his appointments. His years working with heavy equipment has
            rendered him hard of hearing. </p>
        <h3>Ginette</h3>
        <p>Ginette is a retiree with little remaining mobility. She's lived her whole life in french and would have a
            hard time using an english application. She would like an app that not only helps her keep up her exercises
            to improve her diminishing mobility, but would also require an app that caters to her degenerating sight.
            All the while, she aims to make some friends adn keep in touch with her family.</p>
        <h3>Guillaume</h3>
        <p>Guillaume is the only young persona of the bunch. While we were thinking about the demographic of the app, a
            thought came up: "Who else will use the app beside the elderly?". For this reason, we included a younger
            person who might help their grandparent or an elder they know set up their account on the app.</p>
        <h3>Theresa</h3>
        <p>Finally there's Theresa, who represents an elder in the younger range, who wants an app to help keep her fit
            and that keeps track of various merdications. She's pretty tech savvy and aims to reduce the cluter on her
            phone by combining finding an app that combines multiple functionalities.</p>

    <section id="section4">
        <h2>User flow</h2>
        <h3>Journey map</h3>
        <img class="zoomable-image" src="./ImgSrc/User journey map.png" alt="Image 4" onmousemove="zoomImage(event)">
        <p>Hover to zoom in.<br><br>Above is the journey map of a given user.<br>It begins with their needs, what they're looking for the app to deliver. It then goes to the realization, where they realize that their needs can perhaps be met with an all in one app.
        Following is the discovery of the app, where they find the app and decide to download it. They then set up and get to know the app. During their usage of the app, they determine whether their needs are met using the various functionalities of the app.
